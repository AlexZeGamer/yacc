- [x] Add a way to print trees beautifully (for debug)
- [ ] Improve error handling and reporting for compilation errors
  - [ ] Make explicit error classes for different error types (LexerError, ParserError, SemanticError, etc.)
  - [ ] Add line/column info to all errors (requires adding position tracking in tokens)
- [ ] Write a README.md (project overview, how to run, how to install, how to run tests, what's implemented & what's missing, etc.)
  - [ ] Put a schema of the pipeline (Mermaid schema from Notion) + examples
  - [ ] Make a README in EN (default) and FR
