# TODO
- [x] Handle comments in lexer
  - [x] One line comments (//)
  - [x] Multi-line comments (/* ... */)
- [x] Implement parser methods
- [x] Add a arg to output the generated assembly to stdout
- [x] Add a way to get the input from a string
- [x] Add a way to get the input from stdin
- [x] Add verbose/debug modes
  - [x] Think about how to handle verbose mode being enabled the the same time as --stdout (print to stderr?)
- [ ] Add tests for lexer, parser, optimizer, codegen
- [x] Add a way to print trees beautifully (for debug)
- [ ] Improve error handling and reporting for compilation errors
  - [x] Make a custom error class for compilation errors, with line/column info, etc.
  - [x] Make error messages more user-friendly (show line of code, point to error position, etc.)
  - [ ] Make explicit error classes for different error types (LexerError, ParserError, SemanticError, etc.)
  - [ ] Add line/column info to all errors (requires adding position tracking in tokens)
- [x] Write a README.md (project overview, how to run, how to install, how to run tests, what's implemented & what's missing, etc.)
  - [x] Put a schema of the pipeline (Mermaid schema from Notion) + examples
  - [x] Make a README in EN (default) and FR
  - [ ] Add a detailed feature list (what's implemented, what's missing, what's planned)
  - [ ] Add how to run the tests in the README (once tests are done)
- [ ] Make the project available on PyPI
- [x] Bundle the simulator with the project
- [ ] Add a way to make an executable from the generated assembly?
- [ ] Code readability improvements
  - [x] Add type hints everywhere
  - [ ] Add docstrings to all methods and classes
  - [ ] Rename some minifications (e.g. parser functions)
